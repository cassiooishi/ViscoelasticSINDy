# ViscoelasticSINDy
These codes were used to construct the results of the paper ``Nonlinear Parametric Models of Viscoelastic Fluid Flows'' by Cassio Oishi, Alan Kaptanoglu, J. Nathan Kutz, and Steven L. Brunton. Below, we build data-driven models for the temporal POD modes from viscoelastic fluid flows.
