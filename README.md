# ViscoelasticSINDy
These codes were used to construct the results of the paper ``Nonlinear Parametric Models of Viscoelastic Fluid Flows'' by Cassio Oishi, Alan Kaptanoglu, J. Nathan Kutz, and Steven L. Brunton. Below, we build data-driven models for the temporal POD modes from viscoelastic fluid flows. Due to the limitation in uploading large datasets, all simulation data can be found in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ukKo8uuNUAW2GIStLC4oWOBPFJlzBlBR?usp=drive_link
